They are used to store multiple values in a single variable.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Declaring an array\r\nfruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\r\n\r\n# Accessing array elements\r\nprint(fruits[0])  # Outputs: Apple\r\n\r\n# Adding an element to the array\r\nfruits.append(\"Orange\")\r\nprint(fruits)  # Outputs: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Orange']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Linked Lists\r\n\r\nA linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Node class\r\nclass Node:\r\n    def __init__(self, data):\r\n        self.data = data\r\n        self.next = None\r\n\r\n# LinkedList class\r\nclass LinkedList:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.head = None\r\n\r\n    # Add a node to the end of the list\r\n    def append(self, data):\r\n        new_node = Node(data)\r\n        if self.head is None:\r\n            self.head = new_node\r\n        else:\r\n            current = self.head\r\n            while current.next:\r\n                current = current.next\r\n            current.next = new_node\r\n\r\n    # Print the list\r\n    def print_list(self):\r\n        current = self.head\r\n        while current:\r\n            print(current.data)\r\n            current = current.next\r\n\r\n# Example usage\r\nlist = LinkedList()\r\nlist.append(1)\r\nlist.append(2)\r\nlist.append(3)\r\nlist.print_list()  # Outputs: 1 2 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n> 💡 **Tip:** Linked lists are excellent for frequent insertions and deletions, while arrays are better for random access.\r\n\r\n### Stacks\r\n\r\nA stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort or merge sort.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\r\n    n = len(arr)\r\n    for i in range(1, n):\r\n        key = arr[i]\r\n        j = i - 1\r\n\r\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position\r\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\r\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\r\n            j -= 1\r\n        arr[j + 1] = key\r\n    return arr\r\n\r\n# Example usage\r\narr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]\r\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\r\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Outputs: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]\r\n```", "order": 3, "created_at": "2025-05-16T07:38:43.157Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-16T07:38:43.157Z"}}, {"model": "learn.section", "pk": 30, "fields": {"course": 5, "title": "Advanced Topics", "content": "## Advanced Topics\r\n\r\nHere are some advanced data structures and algorithms that are widely used in computer science:\r\n\r\n### Hash Tables\r\n\r\nHash tables are used to store key-value pairs.

Java Operators\r\n\r\nOperators in Java perform various operations on variables and values. Here's a breakdown of all the types of operators:\r\n\r\n### 5.1 Arithmetic Operators\r\n\r\nUsed for performing basic arithmetic operations.\r\n\r\n- `+` (Addition) - Adds two values\r\n- `-` (Subtraction) - Subtracts one value from another\r\n- `*` (Multiplication) - Multiplies two values\r\n- `/` (Division) - Divides one value by another\r\n- `%` (Modulus) - Returns the remainder of a division\r\n- `++` (Increment) - Increases a value by 1\r\n- `--` (Decrement) - Decreases a value by 1\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint x = 5;\r\nint y = 2;\r\nSystem.out.println(x + y); // 7\r\nSystem.out.println(x % y); // 1\r\nSystem.out.println(++x);   // 6 (Increment)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.2 Comparison Operators\r\n\r\nComparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (true/false).\r\n\r\n- `==` (Equal to) - Checks if two values are equal\r\n- `!=` (Not equal to) - Checks if two values are not equal\r\n- `>` (Greater than)\r\n- `<` (Less than)\r\n- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)\r\n- `<=` (Less than or equal to)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint a = 10;\r\nint b = 20;\r\nSystem.out.println(a == b);  // false\r\nSystem.out.println(a < b);   // true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.3 Logical Operators\r\n\r\nUsed to perform logical \"AND\", \"OR\", and \"NOT\" operations.\r\n\r\n- `&&` (Logical AND) - Returns true if both conditions are true\r\n- `||` (Logical OR) - Returns true if at least one condition is true\r\n- `!` (Logical NOT) - Reverses the result of a condition\r\n\r\n```java\r\nboolean isAdult = true;\r\nboolean hasID = false;\r\nSystem.out.println(isAdult && hasID);  // false\r\nSystem.out.println(isAdult || hasID);  // true\r\nSystem.out.println(!isAdult);          // false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.4 Assignment Operators\r\n\r\nUsed to assign values to variables.\r\n\r\n- `=` (Assigns a value to a variable)\r\n- `+=` (Adds and assigns the value)\r\n- `-=` (Subtracts and assigns the value)\r\n- `*=` (Multiplies and assigns the value)\r\n- `/=` (Divides and assigns the value)\r\n- `%=` (Takes modulus and assigns the value)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint a = 5;\r\na += 3;  // a = a + 3, now a is 8\r\na *= 2;  // a = a * 2, now a is 16\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.5 Bitwise Operators\r\n\r\nOperate on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations.\r\n\r\n- `&` (Bitwise AND)\r\n- `|` (Bitwise OR)\r\n- `^` (Bitwise XOR)\r\n- `~` (Bitwise NOT)\r\n- `<<` (Left shift)\r\n- `>>` (Right shift)\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint a = 5;  // 0101 in binary\r\nint b = 7;  // 0111 in binary\r\nSystem.out.println(a & b);  // 0101 (5 in decimal)\r\nSystem.out.println(a | b);  // 0111 (7 in decimal)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 5.6 Ternary Operator\r\n\r\nThe ternary operator is a shortcut for `if-else` statements.\r\n\r\nSyntax: `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint age = 18;\r\nString result = (age >= 18) ? \"Adult\" : \"Minor\";\r\nSystem.out.println(result);  // Outputs: Adult\r\n```", "order": 5, "created_at": "2025-05-16T14:21:29.880Z", "updated_at": "2025-05-16T14:27:18.428Z"}}, {"model": "learn.section", "pk": 37, "fields": {"course": 3, "title": "Conditional Statements in Java", "content": "## 6.
